#About the dataset - The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

Implemented Cifar10 Image Classification Using CNN and batchNormalization on the data.

1. Achieved Training accuracy of 93.8% and Testing accuracy of 84.48% [[cifar10_cnn]](https://github.com/anurag2996/Project-cifar10/blob/master/cifar10_cnn.ipynb)
